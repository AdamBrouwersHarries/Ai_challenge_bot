TODO LIST
1) restructure movement code.
	-high level, deciding action to take if cannot move as we want to...
		-refactor the decision loop, to take into account actions when moving is impossible...
	-potentially install some sort of wall following for when we can't move...
		-could be part of the deciding action refactoring - we already have ants moving away when food is far away, but what happens if they're by a wall?
	-or we could add another way of looking at it, but adding some scent, which ants avoid...
		-this would also stop the "conga lines" which keep occuring...
		-we could also have "wall scent" which aims to keep ants away from walls...
	-STOP ANTS COLLIDING!!!!!
